# Thomas the Game Engine
## Usage
Currently being developed in Visual Studio on Windows, thus it is currently distributed with a solution. You should be able to simply load the repo into Visual Studio using the solution. Then all you need to do is run using the Play button.

## Contribution
If you want to go for it. There is no real philosphy behind this project yet, so add on as you see fit. The standard is C++17. Ultimately, Thomas should be able to handle sprite sheets / tile sets (bit maps) and simple 3D graphics, as well as font/text rendering. In the future a GUI may be added as well.
